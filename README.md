## User experience: 

The original task was given to me by Kristine Andersson, a hairdresser wanting to create a front for her business. 
The intention of the page is more a form of digital businesscard, it does Not intend to be an online booking format. <br>

### She wanted: 
* Bright colors, earth tones because the studio is a more bohemic vibe salon. 
* A clean cut page.
* The information about the salon.
* Contact information.
* Picture to show what kind of business it is.
* A short presentation about the salon. <br><br> <br>

-She prefers that the clients call to schedule a visit, and no pricing because of the vast range in pricing due to peoples different needs and requests.

-The service menu ties into the description what kind of services you can expect at Fine Cuts. The page is only meant to be used as a location finder and description. 

-She wanted to keep the page very basic, not too confusing or too much information that the clients do not need in order to know what they want to do. 

-She has approved changes in terms of color, pictures and the overall layout to be to her satisfaction.

-Page perfomance in regards to requests from the client is good.
The pages opens and responds as they should.

## Changes that could be made to make website more user friendly could be: 
* Keeping either pictures clickable or use button in strategic places. 
* Gallery, a cohesive photogallery can be visually pleasing.
* Possibility to book your appointment online. 
* More information on specific products in use. 
* Use visible social media bar so that the customer can se content of said social media platform right away and won’t have to click to a second page.
* Blog, if the client has the time to present what is going on right now, and get to know the client and the salon and how they work.
* A button for online booking makes it accessable for clients if the salon is busy. 
* Online shop for aftercare products to be shipped or picked up at the salon, can help with the productsales, but also something that is somewhat time consuming for a small salons.

-But for this salon it would not have been a good fit right now. And some of those tasks would have been over my skill level at this moment.

## Errors in the readme file:

My misstake in this project has been that I have not worked parallell with the readmefile because I thought the process would be more simple than it was. 

So therefor a few errors I have not taken note on what it was and how I fixed it, but as for the later errors that has occured I have more recollection of the error and what I did to fix it.  

And I will present them below. 

So for the next project I have to take more careful account of the steps I am taking during the project so it is more understandable.

## Errors and warnings
The errors and warnings that was validated that I could remember was as follows:

###  Warnings:
* Forgetting to add lang attribute to every html file.

(Found and deleted, error resolved)

## User story:

Looking around for a hairsalon and in this case I have been recommended one from a friend. I have the name of the company So I first land on the ”Home” page.  <br>

<img width="950" alt="home" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120245604/215983667-ffc960fc-0f28-4e37-875e-f26417e84477.png">
<br>

Here I can tell from the header that I have found the right salon. What I really want to know is basically where it is, how much is it, and a phone number. 

From the Home page I scroll down and quickly find out the address and also the map helps me to faster locate how far from my house it is.  <br>
<img width="784" alt="map" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120245604/215983675-db5a3b70-1a8c-4fc3-a4bd-1105ee80815c.png">
<br>



In the menu I find ”Services”, here I expect to find the range of services given but also a price. 

I understand that there are a few different type of services given, but since I am looking for a simple cut and color I see that they do offer this but not a price. 

But the text states I should call.

<br>
So then i head over to the ”contact” page, and here I want to know the phone number, when I click on this page I get everything I need to know again. 

Location and the contact options. I prefer to call and try to get an appointment but I have noted that I can send a message from the page as well, a tool I would use in case the salon does not answer me.
