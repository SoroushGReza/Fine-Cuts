# User experience (UX): <br>

## User Stories
üî≤ As a user, I want to be able to understand the business brand at a first look. <br>
üî≤ As a user, I want to be able to access information about the various beauty treatments available. <br>
üî≤ As a user, I want to be able to find contact information such as, Phone or Email.<br>
üî≤ As a user, I want to be able to find the business location.<br>
üî≤ As a user, I want to be able to find links for the salons social networks, such as Instagram, Facebook and TikTok.<br><br>

## Changes that could be made to make website more user friendly could be: 
* Keeping either pictures clickable or use button in strategic places. 
* Gallery, a cohesive photogallery can be visually pleasing.
* Possibility to book your appointment online. 
* More information on specific products in use. 
* Use visible social media bar so that the customer can se content of said social media platform right away and won‚Äôt have to click to a second page.
* Blog, if the client has the time to present what is going on right now, and get to know the client and the salon and how they work.
* A button for online booking makes it accessable for clients if the salon is busy. 
* Online shop for aftercare products to be shipped or picked up at the salon, can help with the productsales, but also something that is somewhat time consuming for a small salons.

-But for this salon it would not have been a good fit right now. And some of those tasks would have been over my skill level at this moment. <br><br>

# Design <br>
In this section, we will discuss the design considerations for our project. <br><br>

## Color Scheme <br>
The following color scheme was used for the project:
![Color Scheme Image](./assets/images/COLOR%20SCHEME.jpg) <br><br>

## Fonts <br>
For this project, three fonts was selected:

[Noto Serif Toto](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Serif+Toto?query=noto+serif+toto) <br>
[Quicksand](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand?query=quicksand) <br>
[Unbounded](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Unbounded?query=Unbounded) <br>

This fonts was chosen because they are highly legible and look great on both desktop and mobile devices. <br><br>

# Layout <br>
The layout was designed with the following considerations in mind: <br><br>

## Simplicity <br>
The design is clean and uncluttered, with beige and natural tones, to keep it subdued. <br><br>

## Accessibility <br>
We made sure that our design is easy to read and navigate for all users, and on all devices. <br><br>

## Consistency <br>
Consistent visual style was used throughout the whole project, using the same fonts, colors, and layout elements across all pages. <br>

All pages was optimized for different screen sizes, ensuring that our content looks great on everything from large desktop displays to small mobile devices. <br>

Overall, the design choices were made with the goal of creating a professional and user-friendly experience all users. <br><br>

## Errors in the readme file <br>
My misstake in this project has been that I have not worked parallell with the readmefile because I thought the process would be more simple than it was. <br>

So therefor a few errors I have not taken note on what it was and how I fixed it, but as for the later errors that has occured I have more recollection of the error and what I did to fix it.  <br>

And I will present them below. 

So for the next project I have to take more careful account of the steps I am taking during the project so it is more understandable. <br><br>

# Errors and warnings <br>
The errors and warnings that was validated that I could remember was as follows:

##  Warnings: <br>
