User experience: 

The original task was given to me by Kristine Andersson, a hairdresser wanting to create a front for her business. 
The intention of the page is more a form of digital businesscard, it does Not intend to be an online booking format. 

She wanted: 
Bright colors, earth tones because the studio is a more bohemic vibe salon. 
A clean cut page.
She wanted the information about the salon
Contact information 
Picture to show what kind of business it is 
A short presentation about the salon.
She prefers that the clients call to schedule a visit and no pricing because of the vast range in pricing due to peoples different needs and requests.
The service menu ties into the description what kind of services you can expect at Fine Cuts. 
The page is only meant to be used as a location finder and description. 

She wanted to keep the page very basic, not too confusing or too much information that the clients do not need in order to know what they want to do. 

She has approved changes in terms of color, pictures and the overall layout to be to her satisfaction.

Page perfomance in regards to requests from the client is good.
The pages opens and responds as they should. 

Changes that could be made in order to make it more user friendly could be: 
- Keeping either pictures clickable or use button in strategic places. 
-gallery , a cohesive photogallery can be visually pleasing.
-Possibility to book your appointment online 
- More information on specific products in use 
- Use visible social media bar so that the customer can se content of said social media platform right away and won’t have to click to a second page.
- Blog, if the client has the time to present what is going on right now, and get to know the client and the salon and how they work.
- A button for online booking makes it accessable for clients if the salon is busy. 
- Online shop for aftercare products to be shipped or picked up at the salon, can help with the productsales, but also something that is somewhat time consuming for a small salons and for this salon it would not have been a good fit right now, and it this stage this would be over my skill level to achieve.

Errors in the readme file:

My misstake in this project has been that I have not worked parallell with the readmefile because I thought the process would be more simple than it was. So therefor a few errors I have not taken note on what it was and how I fixed it, but as for the later errors that has occured I have more recollection of the error and what I did to fix it. So for the next project I have to take more careful account of the steps I am taking during the project so it is more understandable.
